# FastIOW

FastIOW is a dotnet library for fast and easy, arduino-like access to Code Mercenaries [IOWarrior](https://www.codemercs.com/io) devices.

This library simplifies the way of handling communication between computer and IOWarrior by abstracting and simplifing various components. It gives newcomers the ability to achive first results quickly.

Experienced developers can use this library to get things fast and and with minimal effort done, so they can focus on their task.
